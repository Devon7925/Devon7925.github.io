![JSON](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JSON-gray?style=flat)

![egui](https://img.shields.io/badge/-egui-gray?style=flat)

A simple infinite canvas drawing tool. It's designed to be truely infinite unlike some other infinite canvas tools that either don't let you zoom in too far, or suffer from floating point precision issues.

![WebGPU](https://img.shields.io/badge/-WebGPU-gray?style=flat)
